# VUB-EZProxy-Redirect
The VUB-EZProxy-Redirect automatically redirects academic links to the [VUB library's MyEZProxy login page](https://myezproxy.vub.ac.be), providing easy access to subscribed academic journals and databases from anywhere, without having to manually go to the VUB library website or typing myezproxy in the address bar.
